An NFT is a virtual token that you create to verifiably prove authenticity and ownership of digital assets such as art, collectibles, and more. It cannot be replicated, and no one else can claim it's theirs.

Non-fungible means that you could use it to describe things that are not interchangeable for other items because they have unique properties. This is different from fungible items that can be interchanged as often as you want.

For example, you can exchange a US-dollar with any other US-dollars. If you lend a dollar to someone, you don't need the exact same dollar with the same serial number, right? This is fungibility. However, if you lend someone a limited-edition baseball card, you need the same exact limited edition baseball card. Another example is a plane ticket, you cannot exchange your ticket with someone else, this is non-fungibility.
