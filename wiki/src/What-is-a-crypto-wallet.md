### Introduction

A crypto wallet is an application or hardware device that allows you to store and transfer different cryptocurrencies and assets. This guide breaks down the crypto wallet basics that you'll need to know before creating and trading items on Niftgen. Please also see the Algorand Wallet Set up for an in-depth walkthrough on how to set up your wallet.

### How do crypto wallets work?

When you create a crypto wallet, you have both a **public key** (wallet address) and a **private key** (seed phrase). You can think of your public key as your shareable email address, so you can copy and paste it in when people ask for your email address. Your private key works like the password to access your email account and should remain private. In Web 3, a seed phrase is composed of 24 different words. If you want to sign in your wallet on a new device, you will usually need to write down those 24 words. However, some wallets allow the possibility of QR codes.

### Crypto Wallets and Niftgen?

Decentralized applications, or "dApps", work differently from traditional websites like Amazon. When you purchase an item on Niftgen, the funds go straight from your crypto wallet to the seller's wallet. There's no company in the middle holding the goods while the transaction goes through

### What wallets do we support?

We currently accept 2 different wallets on Niftgen: Pera mobile wallet, and MyAlgo.

### Security: Keeping your funds safe

Niftgen never stores your funds or assets, which means that we can't retrieve them if you lose access to your wallet or it's compromised. If you forget your password, you can get access to your wallet via your seed phrase, a series of words that accompany all wallet addresses. It's good practice to write down and safely store your seed phrase in multiple places.
