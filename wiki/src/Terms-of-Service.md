### Terms of Service

Last Updated: August 22, 2022

### 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Niftgen website ("Niftgen", "we", "us" or "our"). These Terms of Use (these "Terms") govern your access to and use of the Niftgen website; including without limitation the creation, purchase, sale, exchange, or modification of certain digital assets; our online and/or mobile services, and software provided on or in connection with those services (collectively, the "Service").

This Service also allows you to sell and purchase Crypto Assets (as defined below) via auction ("Auction"). You may only participate in the platform by linking your Algorand digital wallets, such as Algorand Mobile wallet, My Algo wallet, or supported browser extensions such as AlgoSigner. (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/algosigner/kmmolakhbgdlpkjkcjkebenjheonagdm). These are all electronic wallets, which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Algorand cryptocurrency (ALGO).

Before putting up your unique digital asset for Auction or putting in an offer to purchase a unique digital asset from another user, we will ask you to use one of the acceptable wallets used in on the Algorand blockchain: AlgoSigner ( browser extension, works best on google chrome), My Algo wallet, Algorand Wallet ( this is the mobile app and it will be renamed to Pera wallet in the future).

Once you submit an order to sell or purchase a unique digital asset, your order is passed on to the applicable extension, which completes the transaction on your behalf. Important points on the Algorand blockchain compatible wallets - AlgoSigner, MyAlgo and Algorand Wallet ( this is a mobile wallet and will be renamed Pera Wallet in the future):

1. We use Algorand technology to process all the payments on Niftgen, and AlgoSigner, MyAlgo, or Algorand Wallet to store Algo or NFT (Non-Fungible Token) that represents unique tradable digital items.
2. We are not responsible in case you lose access to your Wallet. You are fully responsible to store your mnemonic words (seed phrase) to be able to access or recover your Wallet.
3. We do not have responsibilities in case someone accesses your wallet and makes some transactions without your authorization.
4. We do not have a refund policy. When you process a payment, you are fully aware that this payment is final.
5. We do not provide insurance to the user to make money with their Content.
6. We do not have the responsibility in case Algorand loses value. We decided to use Algorand for his technology, but its native asset ALGO is potentially highly volatile. We are not responsible for the potential loss you can have in case of asset depreciation. Prices are decided by a free market and Niftgen has no control over them.
7. We do not promise any returns on any investment of any form. In the case of assets associated with Niftgen, they should not be regarded as an investment contract of any kind.

"Crypto Assets" refers to unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs), implemented on the Algorand blockchain (the "Algorand Platform") using smart contracts.

ALL TRANSACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH OUR SERVICE ARE FACILITATED AND RUN BY THIRD-PARTY ELECTRONIC WALLET EXTENSIONS, AND BY USING OUR SERVICES YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE APPLICABLE EXTENSIONS.
Niftgen IS A PLATFORM. WE ARE NOT A BROKER, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OR CREDITOR. THE SERVICES ARE AN ADMINISTRATIVE PLATFORM ONLY.
Niftgen FACILITATES TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER IN THE AUCTION BUT IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER OF CRYPTO ASSETS OR BETWEEN ANY USERS.

YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS YOU PURCHASE ON Niftgen.
NOTWITHSTANDING INDICATORS AND MESSAGES THAT SUGGEST VERIFICATION, Niftgen MAKES NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS ON THE PLATFORM.

Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to describe additional terms for specific services. Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services.
THESE TERMS OF USE ARE IMPORTANT AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, SO PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY. WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING; AND (2) YOU ARE AGREEING TO MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION FOR THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES AND WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS. PLEASE READ SECTION 15 CAREFULLY.

BY CLICKING ON THE "COMPLETE SIGN UP" BUTTON, COMPLETING THE ACCOUNT REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING OUR SERVICES AND/OR PURCHASING CRYPTO ASSETS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service or purchase the Crypto Assets.

Niftgen reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an email notification, providing notice through the Service or updating the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference.

WHILE Niftgen ATTEMPTS TO MAKE YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE AND CONTENT SAFE, Niftgen CANNOT AND DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE, CONTENT, ANY CRYPTO ASSETS LISTED ON OUR SERVICE OR OUR SERVERS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF ANY DATA THAT YOU DISCLOSE ONLINE. YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET AND WILL NOT HOLD US RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.

WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS AND TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR, ANY USE OF CRYPTO ASSETS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (A) USER ERROR SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS, INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS, OR MISTYPED ADDRESSES; (B) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (C) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES; (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS; (E) ANY UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST THE SERVICE OR CRYPTO ASSETS.

3. Our Service does not store, send, or receive Crypto Assets. This is because Crypto Assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain. Any transfer of Crypto Assets occurs within the supporting blockchain and not on this Service.
4. There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Niftgen will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Crypto Assets, however caused.
5. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of Crypto Assets.
6. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Auction and/or Service and the utility of Crypto Assets.
7. The Service will rely on third-party platforms to perform the transactions for the Auction of crypto assets. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.
8. There are risks associated with purchasing user generated content, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable. Niftgen reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on Niftgen. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on Niftgen serve as grounds for a claim against Niftgen.

### 13. Limitation of Liability

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY OF Niftgen FOR (A) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY A MEMBER OF Niftgenâ€™S NEGLIGENCE; OR FOR (B) ANY INJURY CAUSED BY A MEMBER OF Niftgenâ€™S FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims.

### 14. Modifications to the Service

We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any features or parts thereof) or suspend or discontinue the Auction at any time and without liability therefore.\

Although the Offerings may be available in other jurisdictions, each User hereby acknowledges and agrees that such availability shall not be deemed to give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction over Niftgen Company in any forum outside the State of Delaware.

Any such dispute, claim or cause of action that is not finally resolved by a binding, written settlement agreement within such 60 days shall be brought and resolved exclusively in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 10.

**Agreement to Binding, Exclusive Arbitration.**
(a) Mandatory Binding Arbitration. Except as set forth in "Settlement Negotiation" section, all claims, disputes and controversies directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with or directly or indirectly relating to these Terms or any of the matters or transactions contemplated by these Terms (for the avoidance of doubt, including any claim seeking to invalidate, or alleging that, all or any part of these Terms is unenforceable, void or voidable) (such claims, disputes and controversies, collectively, "Disputes") shall be finally settled by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court, agency or other governmental authority, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes.

(b) Waiver of Jury Trial. The parties hereby acknowledge, represent and warrant that they understand that: (i) there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and, absent this mandatory provision, the parties would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial concerning Disputes; (ii) in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation; (iii) the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court; and (iv) court review of an arbitration award is limited. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the transactions contemplated hereby.

**Arbitration Procedures**. Niftgen Company or any User may initiate an arbitration proceeding by delivering written notice to the other, whereupon the parties shall reasonably cooperate to select an arbitrator and submit the relevant Dispute to such arbitrator. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within 15 days from the filing of a demand for arbitration, the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") shall appoint the arbitrator. Any such arbitration shall be administered by the AAA in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the AAA excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Niftgen Company will not seek attorneysâ€™ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitratorâ€™s award shall be written and reasoned, and binding on the parties, and may be entered by any party as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**Seat of Arbitration**. The seat of arbitration shall be Wilmington, Delaware. The arbitrator may choose to have the arbitration of any Dispute conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or at a mutually agreed location; provided, however, that Niftgen Company may opt to transfer the venue of any arbitration hearing to Wilmington, Delaware in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs a User may reasonably incur as a result of the change in venue, as determined by the arbitrator, and, subject to the foregoing, a User hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Wilmington, Delaware, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

**Confidentiality of Arbitration**. Except to the extent necessary to enforce their respective rights under these Terms or as otherwise required by applicable law, the parties undertake to maintain confidentiality as to the existence and events of the arbitration proceedings and as to all submissions,correspondence and evidence relating to the arbitration proceedings. This provision shall survive the termination of the arbitral proceedings.

**Class Action Waiver.**
(a) No Class Actions Permitted. All Users hereby agree that any arbitration or other permitted action with respect to any Dispute shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the Users expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. USERS SHALL BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Niftgen COMPANY OTHER ONLY IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

(b) Agreements if Class Action Waiver Unenforceable. If any court or arbitrator makes a final, binding and non-appealable determination that the class action waiver set forth in this Section 10.7 is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void with respect to any Dispute that would thus be required to be resolved by arbitration on a class basis, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate such Dispute. In the event that, as a result of the application of the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise, any Dispute is not subject to arbitration, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware and to accept service of process by mail with respect to such Dispute, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available with respect to such Dispute.

### 16. Severability. In the event that any provision of these Terms, or the application of any such provision to any person or set of circumstances, shall be determined by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any extent: (a) the remainder of these Terms, and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; and (b) Rarible Company shall have the right to modify these Terms so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consumed as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
