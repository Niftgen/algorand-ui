### Introduction

**What is Niftgen:** is a hub for video creators to better monetize their content. It's an ecosystem where users are actually rewarded for their engagement.

**What Problem are we solving:** 98% of video 65+ million video creators earn less than $12,000 per year (below US poverty line). The cause is low engagement rates.

**What is our Solution:** Reward users for their engagement with platform tokens. Tokens will be used to access utilities such as vote on content creation during live streams.

### More Details on the problem and Niftgen's solution:

Video creators primarily rely on Web 2.0 platforms such as YouTube and Twitch to monetize their content.On these platforms, creators make money through ad revenue and brand sponsorships (YouTube) and/or subscription fees (Twitch). On YouTube, creators need to consistently increase their subscriber base and engagement to fully monetize their content. On Twitch, creators need to constantly keep their fans engaged to at least retain their subscriber base. If they want more revenue, then they need to produce even more and better content, not to mention spending many hours on sales and marketing.

Nearly all creators have low engagement (any form of interaction with their content; likes, shares, subscriptions, views, etc.), usually below 5%, with the average engagement rate on YouTube for November 2022 being just 1.64% . Financially, this means that even if a creator gets around 100,000 views per day for one yearâ€“which is highly unlikely given that only 0.77% of videos ever reach that milestone, with 88.4% of YouTube videos getting less than 1000 views--they can expect to make no more than $16,094. This is a major reason why 97.5% of YouTubers don't make enough to even reach the U.S. federal poverty line of $12,140. Or why less than 1% of Twitch streamers can make a living.

There are several purely crypto/Web3 video platforms such as Odysee, DTube, DLive, etc. These platforms emerged during the last decade as seemingly decentralized alternatives to YouTube and Twitch. On many of them, even the UI and monetization models are YouTube-esque. Unfortunately, so is the average engagement and monetization rate for creators on those (for details, please see Part 3, crypto video platforms).

Our hypothesis is that low engagement rates are primarily caused by the fact that a) fans are not well rewarded for their engagement; and b) fans do not actively participate in content creation.

On Niftgen, users will be rewarded for their engagement. The rewards will be in the form of native platform (Niftgen) tokens. Users will earn tokens by watching, rating, sharing, and commenting on videos. Users will then be able to use these tokens to access different utilities. Examples include access to exclusive content, schedule calls with their favorite creator, and vote on the content a creator produces during a live stream. Therefore, users are rewarded for their engagement and empowered to participate in content creation. This should increase engagement rates for most creators.
