## Main Point

98% of video creators earn less than $12,000/year ( bellow US poverty line). And the other 2% that make more are still not properly compensated for their efforts. It doesn't cost video creators anything to try Niftgen. And we argue, it will be a much better monetization tool than YouTube or Twitch. Niftgen can be the platform where they produce more exclusive/ high-quality content.

### The Creator Pool.

At the end of each month, the funds in the creator pool will be equally dispersed to all verified video creators on the platform. Community is the core of Web 3.0. The purpose of the creator pool is to support the creator community as a whole. This differentiates Niftgen from the competition. We view the creator ecosystem as a decentralized collective of creative force and community building. It’s a community rather than a large collection of atomized individuals.

The creator pool will strongly incentivize creators to support their community. The better off the community is–the greater the creator pool–the better off each individual creator is. Creators will benefit from users subscribing to Niftgen even if they subscribe directly on the platform or through the invitation from another creator. All video creators will benefit from the subscribers growth of Niftgen.

### Quality over Quantity

Niftgen’s helps creators earn more by doing less. Creators will earn more for each piece of content. Therefore, the focus will be on quality rather than quantity.
